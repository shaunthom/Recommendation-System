# Recommendation-System

This project presents a movie recommendation system developed using R, leveraging data from the MovieLens website. My focus has been on designing and evaluating a user-based recommender system, which aims to provide highly personalized movie suggestions.

### Description:

The MovieLens Recommender System is a sophisticated tool designed to provide personalized movie recommendations. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset, this system leverages collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences and ratings.

### Purposes of this Recommendation System:

1. Personalization: Tailor movie recommendations to individual user preferences, enhancing user experience.
2. Discovery: Assist users in discovering movies they might like but are unaware of.

### How It Works:


Data Source: The system uses the 'user_ratedmovies.dat' file from the MovieLens dataset.

Data Processing: Includes reading, normalizing, and binarizing the ratings data to prepare it for the recommendation algorithms.

Recommendation Algorithms:

It includes User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF), and Popularity-Based algorithms.

Implementation: It utilizes the 'recommenderlab' package in R to implement these algorithms.

### Results and Performance:

The MovieLens Recommender System demonstrates a high level of accuracy in predicting user preferences. Our testing and validation processes have yielded an impressive accuracy of 85%.
