# Recommendation-System
This is a movie recommendation system. It has been executed using R. The data was collected through the MovieLens web site. 
We can see the help file on the data to understand how to best manipulate the object. In this file, we have designed and evaluated a user-based recommender
system. Specifically, we created a system so that it outputs a userâ€™s top ten recommendations. In this specific code, we have performed a demo on 3 such users.
It is possible to demo it on as many users, i.e. we could see the top 10 recommendations on as many users as we wish. 3 is also just a custom number as we
could see even further deeply. We could see a particular user's top 100 favorites as well.
